# Fruit Surface and Soil Microbiome Project

## Overview

Welcome to the live journal, a.k.a. raw notes dump, for the Fruit Surface and Soil Microbiome Project. This page is a hub for documenting our research and learning opportunities.

## Objective

The goal of this page is to maintain an organized, chronological archive of raw notes and observations that arise during this project. It will assist in tracking the development of our methodologies and the evolution of our data analysis strategies, ensuring reproducibility and continuous improvement in our research practices.

## Structure

Journal entries include, but are not limited to:

- Bioinformatics Workflow: Drafts of code, error logs, successful scripts, and version updates
- Educational Activities: Insights and key takeaways from Project-related seminars, workshops, and training sessions
- Literature Insights: Recent studies, relevant scientific literature, and metagenomic tools that may inform and drive our research forward

## Navigation

Notes are categorized by date and are searchable. Each entry is written to provide quick insights into the challenges and solutions employed, offering a transparent view of the bioinformatics analysis happenings.

Please share any suggestions or ideas to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of this page.
