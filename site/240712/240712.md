### 1. NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
- **Scope**: Broad
- **Database**: Includes a comprehensive collection of sequences and annotations for a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and some protists.
- **Screening Capability**: Can screen genes from protists, archaea, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.
- Provides access to various specialized databases, such as GenBank for sequences and the Pathogen Detection database for antimicrobial resistance.

### 2. CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)
- **Scope**: Focused on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes
- **Database**: Primarily includes AMR genes from bacteria.
- **Screening Capability**: Mainly bacteria.
- Offers a curated collection of AMR genes and associated metadata but does not fully cover AMR genes in archaea, fungi, protists, or viruses.

### 3. ARG-ANNOT (Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation)
- **Scope**: Focused on antibiotic resistance genes
- **Database**: Includes AMR genes from bacteria.
- **Screening Capability**: Mainly bacteria.
- Provides a specialized resource for identifying antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial genomes.

### 4. Resfinder
- **Scope**: Focused on identifying resistance genes in bacteria
- **Database**: Includes resistance genes from bacteria.
- **Screening Capability**: Mainly bacteria.
- Used to detect resistance genes in bacterial genomes and plasmids, relying on an extensive database of known bacterial resistance genes.

### 5. MEGARES (MEtaGenome Analysis Resource for Antimicrobial Resistance)
- **Scope**: Focused on antimicrobial resistance genes
- **Database**: Includes AMR genes from bacteria and some from archaea.
- **Screening Capability**: Mainly bacteria, with some coverage of archaea.
- Provides a resource for AMR gene annotation in metagenomic datasets, focusing on bacterial resistance genes.

### Summary Table:

| Database  | Protists | Archaea | Fungi | Bacteria           | Viruses |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------- |
| NCBI      | Yes      | Yes     | Yes   | Yes                | Yes     |
| CARD      | No       | No      | No    | Yes                | No      |
| ARG-ANNOT | No       | No      | No    | Yes                | No      |
| Resfinder | No       | No      | No    | Yes                | No      |
| MEGARES   | No       | Yes     | No    | Yes                | No      |
| EcOH      | No       | No      | No    | Yes (E. coli only) | No      |

- **NCBI** comprehensive search across multiple organism types.
- **CARD**, **ARG-ANNOT**, and **Resfinder** are most effective for bacterial AMR gene screening.
- **MEGARES** offers broader AMR gene coverage including some archaea but is still predominantly bacterial.
