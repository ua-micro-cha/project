Tucson Water illustrating water supply changes over time. Before the early 2000s, Tucson was the largest metro area in the United States that was completely dependent on groundwater. Renewable Colorado River supplies have now replaced groundwater supplies as the predominant supply. As Colorado River water was brought online and groundwater pumping stopped, aquifer levels have recovered in some areas as much as 75 feet. Colorado river water is stored in an aquifer through a process called recharge.

Tucson Water About 80% of our water comes from the Colorado River. The Colorado River watershed is divided into an upper and lower basin and provides water to over 40 million people. Tucson annual allocation is 144,000 acre feet, while Tucson demand is only about 100,000 acre feet. Over the past years, about six years' worth of this water has been stored in local aquifers. In recent years, Tucson voluntarily left water in Lake Mead to help protect the Colorado River system, and this is known as compensated system conservation.

Arizona dept of agriculture:  waxing and also fungicides that are applied to certain commodities, citrus being one of them. This water is used not only for hand washing but also for cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and with all of these postharvest water uses, one has to ensure this water that is safe with no detectable generic E. coli.

Not only does water quality affect crop quality, but soil does too. So here in Arizona, we have a wide variety of soils and a lot are not too ideal for growing. E.g., this slide which depicts an arizona geological survey map illustrating exapansive, clay-ladden soil hotspots. Other soils have a high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium aka hard water which corrodes agricultural equipment, which can serve as a substrate for microbes like biofilms.
 
Also, mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with plant roots, extending their network through the soil to enhance water and nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus. However, certain conditions in hard mineral-heavy soils can inhibit this relationship and negatively affect plant growth. A large number of growers use inherently high-salinity groundwater which needs to be treated so it does not hinder the growing of produce.

cdc released updated antimicrobial resistance (amr) fact-sheet last month in July: (1) 20% increase during pandemic than before pandemic and (2) pathogenic yeast infections increased five-fold

![slide10](./assets/2408/slide10.png) 

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem and this 2022 paper shows that the "gbd" global burden of disease by mortality rates is higher in regions with fewer resources worldwide.

and this is another visualization from the same paper, and again, mortality rates on the y-axis. But infectious syndromes are now on the x-axis, and you can see that lower respiratory infections, bloodstream infections and intra-abdominal infections make up for most the amr-attributed deaths.

![slide12](./assets/2408/slide12.png) 

On this slide, the x-axis now reflects the pathogens that have the most resistance and number one is *E. coli*. But a variety exists with both gram negative and positive.

The Institute of Food Technologists has a catalog of traceability awareness courses with a lot of different media and delivery systems designed to raise awareness of basic traceability principles, highlight key concepts, definitions, and best practices for staff. Has downloadable resources, such as videos that employers can play "in the break room" or posters that can be hung up. And this also includes a train the trainer or traceability manager training that is focused on best practices for training staff members responsible for data collection.
