Tucson Water illustrating water supply changes over time. Before the early 2000s, Tucson was the largest metro area in the United States that was completely dependent on groundwater. Renewable Colorado River supplies have now replaced groundwater supplies as the predominant supply. As Colorado River water was brought online and groundwater pumping stopped, aquifer levels have recovered in some areas as much as 75 feet. Colorado river water is stored in an aquifer through a process called recharge.

Tucson Water About 80% of our water comes from the Colorado River. The Colorado River watershed is divided into an upper and lower basin and provides water to over 40 million people. Tucson annual allocation is 144,000 acre feet, while Tucson demand is only about 100,000 acre feet. Over the past years, about six years' worth of this water has been stored in local aquifers. In recent years, Tucson voluntarily left water in Lake Mead to help protect the Colorado River system, and this is known as compensated system conservation.
