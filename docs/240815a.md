Tucson Water illustrating water supply changes over time. Before the early 2000s, Tucson was the largest metro area in the United States that was completely dependent on groundwater. Renewable Colorado River supplies have now replaced groundwater supplies as the predominant supply. As Colorado River water was brought online and groundwater pumping stopped, aquifer levels have recovered in some areas as much as 75 feet. Colorado river water is stored in an aquifer through a process called recharge.

Tucson Water About 80% of our water comes from the Colorado River. The Colorado River watershed is divided into an upper and lower basin and provides water to over 40 million people. Tucson annual allocation is 144,000 acre feet, while Tucson demand is only about 100,000 acre feet. Over the past years, about six years' worth of this water has been stored in local aquifers. In recent years, Tucson voluntarily left water in Lake Mead to help protect the Colorado River system, and this is known as compensated system conservation.

Arizona dept of agriculture:  waxing and also fungicides that are applied to certain commodities, citrus being one of them. This water is used not only for hand washing but also for cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and with all of these postharvest water uses, one has to ensure this water that is safe with no detectable generic E. coli.

Not only does water quality affect crop quality, but soil does too. So here in Arizona, we have a wide variety of soils and a lot are not too ideal for growing. E.g., this slide which depicts an arizona geological survey map illustrating exapansive, clay-ladden soil hotspots. Other soils have a high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium aka hard water which corrodes agricultural equipment, which can serve as a substrate for microbes like biofilms.
 
Also, mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with plant roots, extending their network through the soil to enhance water and nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus. However, certain conditions in hard mineral-heavy soils can inhibit this relationship and negatively affect plant growth. A large number of growers use inherently high-salinity groundwater which needs to be treated so it does not hinder the growing of produce.

cdc released updated antimicrobial resistance (amr) fact-sheet last month in July: (1) 20% increase during pandemic than before pandemic and (2) pathogenic yeast infections increased five-fold

![slide10](./assets/2408/slide10.png) 

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem and this 2022 paper shows that the "gbd" global burden of disease by mortality rates is higher in regions with fewer resources worldwide.

and this is another visualization from the same paper, and again, mortality rates on the y-axis. But infectious syndromes are now on the x-axis, and you can see that lower respiratory infections, bloodstream infections and intra-abdominal infections make up for most the amr-attributed deaths.

![slide12](./assets/2408/slide12.png) 

On this slide, the x-axis now reflects the pathogens that have the most resistance and number one is *E. coli*. But a variety exists with both gram negative and positive.

western leafy green marketing agreement, ca growers assn. Members are required to submit quarterly reports based on USDA checklists. They are data sharing and audit oriented. However, they are sensitive to inflicting "audit fatigue" on their members and working on solutions to prevent it.

The is a screenshot from a tracabability course offered by the Institute of Food Technologists has a catalog of traceability awareness courses with a lot of different media and delivery systems designed to raise awareness of basic traceability principles, highlight key concepts, definitions, and best practices for staff. Has downloadable resources, such as videos that employers can play "in the break room" (!) or posters that can be hung up. And this also includes a train the trainer or traceability manager training that is focused on best practices for training staff members responsible for data collection.

Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger technology that protects transactions across multiple computers, ensuring transparency and traceability with no need for a central authority. Although sound for enhancing food supply chain transparency, its feasibility is limited if growers find it uneconomical, cumbersome out in the field, struggle with a learning curve, or if only a few adopt the system. This lack of widespread adoption prevents standardization, underscoring the need for a more practical and accessible solution. Ultimately, the last few slides demonstrate that no one on this Earth is able to be comforted by the fact that they'll never be affected by foodborne illnesses. Finding the source of any outbreak is vital; however, it's better to prevent any foodborne outbreak from happening at all.

What if natural microbial communities with similar sensitivities to the sanitizers like the pathogens could be used as a microbial index? This could be used for on-site validating and verifying the sanitizing washwater systems. But as of right now, the composition of microbial populations on different fruit surfaces at the point of harvest is very limited to non-existent. And you can't build a microbial index until these communities are characterized. Not only do you have to find out what's there, but what they're doing.

our lab analyzed bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequenced data from samples taken from the surfaces of apples, oranges, and peaches periodically throughout 2 growing seasons at the point of harvest from California commercial orchards in Courtland, Exeter, and Kingsburg.

Fig. A is of the apple carposphere observations.
Year 1 Early vs. Year 1 Middle and Late: Noticeable decrease in Shannon diversity from the early to the middle harvest time point in Year 1, followed by a stabilization during the late harvest period. This suggests that bacterial diversity may decline as the season progresses.

Year 2 Early: Increase in Shannon diversity in the early harvest period of Year 2 compared to the middle and late periods of Year 1. May indicate that the bacterial communities start fresh with higher diversity at the beginning of a new season.

Fig. B Temporal Changes:  presents a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plot which shows clear clustering of bacterial communities based on the harvest time points (early, middle, late) and across the two growing seasons. suggests that the bacterial composition on apple surfaces changes significantly over time and between seasons.

Effect of PMA Treatment: The separation between circles (non-PMA treated, total communities) and triangles (PMA treated, viable communities) indicates differences between total and viable bacterial communities. In some harvest points, these groups cluster closely, suggests that viable communities closely resemble the total communities. In other points, they are more separated, indicates greater differences.

Year 2 vs. Year 1: blue points (Year 2 Early harvest) are separated from the red, orange, and yellow points (Year 1 harvests), indicates a shift in bacterial community composition from the first to the second year. Could be due to seasonal factors, changes in environmental conditions, or other variables not controlled in the study.

Conclusion: dynamic nature of these communities, which change significantly across different harvest periods and between growing seasons. observed differences between PMA-treated and untreated samples underscore the importance of distinguishing between total and viable bacterial communities in ecological studies. Also interesting is that the Methylobacteriaceae family was the one organism that was always there on all fruits surfaces during all time periods.

LEFT:
our lab analyzed metagenomic amr and virulence data from samples taken from the Santa Cruz River in Marana, Tubac, and Nogales after Nogales suffered a massive sewage spill.

Consistency Across Locations: The sequence reads in the middle column from all three locations (Nogales, Tubac, and Marana) share the same classes of antibiotic resistance genes. This suggests that the microbial communities across these locations have similar resistance profiles based on the initial sequencing data.

Differences in Contigs: While the sequence reads show the same antibiotic resistance genes across all locations, the contigs reveal a more diverse and abundant set of antibiotic resistance genes. The contigs list in the righthand column are entirely different from the broader classes detected in the sequence reads. 

RIGHT:
The Marana location shows a relatively low median number of VFs, with most samples clustering close to the lower end of the scale. The presence of outliers indicates a few samples had significantly higher virulence factor counts than the majority, but overall, the spread of data is limited.

Nogales has a higher median number of virulence factors compared to Marana, indicating that the microbial communities in this location have more virulence factors. The box plot shows a wider spread of data, suggesting greater variability in the virulence factor counts from this location. Outliers are present, showing some samples with particularly high VF counts.

Tubac has a median VF count similar to Marana, but the spread of data is narrower. Like the other locations, there are outliers, indicating that a few samples had higher virulence factor counts, but these are relatively rare.
